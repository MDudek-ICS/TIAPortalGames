Some games written in WinCC and VBScript for Siemens Industrial HMIs

These games are done by myself. Assets are scraped from the web or bought from itch.io. Please use only within this project...

As these games are only one during down-time at work and with no intent of sharing, comments are sparse and may make no sense for everybody.

If you are stuck and need some advice, feel free to contact me.

# Implementation

Each game consists of a list of vars, some scripts and a pop-up-screen. Copy all this into your project and you are set.

Some games need Delay-Timers to be playable (animation-frames, input-lags and so on). You need different delay-values for Simulation and real hardware. You need to fiddle around with them to find a playable gamespeed.
